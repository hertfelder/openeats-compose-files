web container:

Memory (1G) is not enough to run the full set and simultaneously compile the web
sources with "web" container. Therefore, use docker compose file web-docker-prod.yml
to compile source files and docker compose file docker-compose.yml to run
api, db and nginx.

reverse proxy:

Do not forget to add traefik to openeats network:
$ docker network connect openeats_default <name of traefik container>

DB persistence:

In original OpenEats sources, the database volume is not mounted in the db
container. Thus, the db will be lost when the container is removed. Do not
forget to add the volume to the db container in the docker compose file.
